# ICE_Project
TEST2
Let's kick some ice

Python 2
medrec requires semidbm.. see ./medrecmanual.md
preProcessing.py requires the python package "Requests" to be installed
MedRec algorithm requires the UMLS metathesaurus which I already downloaded and compressed for use. as ./rxnormParse/rxnorm.pickle.bz2

The scripts I wrote were: search.py, preprocess.py, wrapper.sh, postprocess1.py, and postprocess2.py
